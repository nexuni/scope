# Scope
This demo presents SCOPE , an electric scooter equipped with RF
sensing and License Plate Recognition (LPR) capabilities to achieve
accurate and efficient parking enforcement. SCOPE leverages Ul-
tra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)
technology and incorporates the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-
based RFID localization algorithm for precise parking spot recog-
nition. Our demo presents an end-to-end system that combines
License Plate Recognition (LPR) and RF-based positioning, achiev-
ing 88% accuracy in matching vehicles to their lots and enabling
automated parking enforcement in practical environments. Demo
